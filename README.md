> Question 1: Feature Engineering: Create following features from the column “Datetime” and append it in the same dataframe


1. Hour: Hour in the datetime, e.g., datetime = 5/2/2012 19:00, hour = 19

2.  weekday: e.g., datetime = 5/2/2012 19:00, weekday = Wednesday

3. Month: e.g., datetime = 5/2/2012 19:00, Month = May

4.  date: e.g., datetime = 5/2/2012 19:00, date = 5/2/2012

> Question 2: Find the average number of bookings in each month across years and sort the data in descending order.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Question 3: It has the following three tasks


1. Convert all categorical variables into one-hot encoded features

2. Concat one hot encoded features into original dataframe

3. Remove the original columns from the dataframe.

 Hint: Categorical Variables are = weekday, month, season, weather
